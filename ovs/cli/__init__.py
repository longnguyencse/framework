"""
Not something that we're proud of but it has to be this way :(
The unittest do not require any implementation to run, everything gets mocked
However when loading in all other commands, the imports might/do fetch instances of real implementation
Which don't do anything or cannot be instantiated
Thus we have to import controllers whenever we invoke a command :(
